**Status:** Accepted provisionally. **Decision:** `qwen3.8:27b-mlx` is the primary target for MVP calibration and task tuning.

This is a local-laboratory prioritization, not a claim that it is globally best. Its digest, capabilities, and stable profiles must be measured. Promotion remains contingent on evaluation results.
