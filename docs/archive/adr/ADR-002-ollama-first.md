Since then, among other changes: Ollama and LM Studio were removed (2026-09-19) and PWR runs models on its own MLX engine, with llama.cpp in progress; the conversation became the product loop; the desktop app is Tauri 2 + Angular; conversations run in an Ask or Auto permission mode. **For the current state read** the [README](../../README.md) (status), the roadmap's latest update ([`roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md)), the backlog's *At a glance* ([`backlog.md`](../backlog.md)), [`current-cli.md`](../current-cli.md), [`pwr-serve.md`](../pwr-serve.md) and [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).

# ADR-002: Ollama-first provider

**Status:** Accepted. **Decision:** MVP ships one local Ollama adapter behind `ModelProvider`.

It matches the installed laboratory and lets PWR validate end-to-end contracts early. Ollama HTTP/API behaviours are verified against the installed version and fixtures; native response types stay in adapter code. Consequence: no second provider before provider contract and evaluation evidence exist.
